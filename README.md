This is an implementation of the paper ["Text Understanding from Scratch"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01710) in Keras 2.x.

The model can be found as the class `crepeK2` in `crepe.py`. This contains wrappers in order to fit, evaluate and predict.

A companion Jupyter Notebook file is provided showing an example of using the model for the AG News Dataset. The AG News Dataset is included within the git repository.
